         Object as an instance of class:
         *******************************
         - Properties or Attributes => variables declared inside class
         - Methods => functions inside a class
         
             OOP => A PIE  
         
         Object Literals:
         ****************
         - a way to define an object using a simple and concise syntax
         - a list of zero or more pairs of property names
         - each property is associated with its value
         
         - Using key-value pairs separated by commas:
            > "key" is a string (or identifier), 
            > "value" can be any valid JavaScript data type
                
         - Basically => Key-Value Pairs: 
            > Each key is followed by a colon : 
            > and its corresponding value
         - the "property: value" paris of an object are enclosed in curly braces { }
         - object properties are written inside curly braces { } separated by commas
 
         Any object (class) in any OOP can have two members:
             > Properties: variables inside object
             > Methods: functions inside object
         */

        /* 
        In JavaScript, we can create an object without a class

        In Java, we create a class (as blueprint) then its object(s):

        }

        Student student1 = new Student();
        Student student2 = new Student();
        Student student3 = new Student();

        Object Literal => object without a class!

        Please consider the following symbols:
        - { } => are used to define an object
        - [ ] => for arrays => arrays of object
