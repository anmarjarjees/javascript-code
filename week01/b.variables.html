            Variable is just a container inside the Computer Memory (RAM)
            Random Access Memory that contains some data.

            it's a place to hold some data temporarily while the file still running

        3 ways:
        - var (since the beginning of JS - old way) => globally level scope
        - let (the modern one, added in ES6/ ES2015) => block-level scope
        - const => block-level scope
        */

        // we can declare a variable using using the keyword "var" or "let"
        // no errors for this code!
        var name = "Alex";
        var name = "Chow";

        console.log(name);

        // we can't declare the variables two times with let!
        let user = "Sam";
        user = "Simpson";

        In Java, C# ==> Error
        int x = 1;
        int x = 2;        
        */

        let subject = "JS";
        subject = "JS framework";

        const PROGRAM = "CMPG";
        // PROGRAM = "CSTN";
        // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

        /*
        HINT: Always use "const" unless you know you're going to reassign the value
        */

        let points;
        points = 10;

        // const COLLEGE;
        // 'const' declarations must be initialized.

         Variable Naming Rules:
        1. No spaces, but we can use the underscore symbol: _
        2. We can't start with numbers
        3. We can't add special characters % ^ etc...

        In JS we have a naming convention that we should follow:
        is called "camelCase" ==> myFinalExam

        in other programming languages like C#:
        they have "PascalCase" ==> MyFinalExam

        in other programming languages like Python:
        they have "snake_case" ==> my_final_exam

         examples:
         a variable for full name => var fullName
        */

        // Using the keyword "let" to declare our 3 variables:
        let exam1 = 80;
        let exam2 = 92;
        let exam3 = 87;

        let total = exam1 + exam2 + exam3;
        let avg1 = total / 3;

        // or avg2:
        // do it all in one line...
