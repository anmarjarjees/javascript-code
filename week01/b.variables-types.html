            Variables:
            **********
            Variable is just a container inside the Computer Memory (RAM)
            Random Access Memory that contains some data.

            it's a place to hold some data temporarily while the file still running

            Variables Declarations:
            ***********************
            JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

            > var: (since the beginning of JS - old way) => globally level scope
            Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

            > let (ES6): (the modern one, added in ES6/ ES2015) => block-level scope
            Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

            > const (ES6):
            Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

        // we can declare a variable using using the keyword "var" or "let"
        // Problem with using "var":
        // no errors for this code!
        var age = 22;
        var age = 23; // bad to declare more! one time only
        // no errors for this code also!
        var name = "Alex";
        var name = "Chow";  // bad to declare more! one time only

        console.log(name);

        // we can't declare the variables two times with let!
        let user = "Sam";
        user = "Simpson";

        /*
        In Java, C# ==> Error
        int x = 1;
        int x = 2;        
        */

        let subject = "JS";
        subject = "JS framework";

        /*
        "const" for defining a constant
        the same rule as "let", but with only one difference
        the variable defined with const cannot be reassigned:
        */
        const college = "ILAC";
        //  college = "ABC"; // ERROR
        // Error Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

        /*
           Q) When to use let and const?
           A) We should always use "const" unless we need to reassign a variable
        */

        const PROGRAM = "CMPG"; // using UPPERCASE "PROGRAM" just by convention :-)
        // PROGRAM = "CSTN";
        // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

        /*
        HINT: Always use "const" unless you know you're going to reassign the value
        */

        let points;
        points = 10;

        // const COLLEGE;
        // 'const' declarations must be initialized.

        /*
        JS is not statically typed language:

        so we do not use => const name:string;

        in "TypeScript" which is a superset of JavaScript
        it's JS with some added features
        so it has the static typing feature: look at "TypeScript"
        */

        /*
        Variable Naming Rules:
        **********************
        1. No spaces, but we can use the underscore symbol: _
        2. We can't start with numbers
        3. We can't add special characters % ^ etc...

        Naming Convention:
        ******************
        In JS we have a naming convention that we should follow:
        is called "camelCase" ==> myFinalExam

        in other programming languages like C# and Java:
        they have "PascalCase" ==> MyFinalExam or class name like (Student.cs - Student.java)

        in other programming languages like Python:
        they have "snake_case" ==> my_final_exam

        Example in JavaScript:
        a variable for full name => let fullName = "Alex Chow";
        */

        /*
       Primitive Data Type:
       directly assigned to memory
       - string
       - number
       - boolean
       - null
       - undefined
       - symbol (added in ES6 (2015))
       */
        const name = 'Alex Chow'; // single quote
        const course = "JavaScript"; // double quote
        const age = 30;
        const rating = 4.5;
        const isCool = true;
        const isHot = false;
        const x = null; // empty variable

        /*
        We can explicity define undefined 
        */
        const y = undefined;
        // OR:
        let z; // z is undefined like y


        // using typeof => return the data type
        console.log(typeof name); // string
        console.log(typeof age); // number
        console.log(typeof rating); // number
        console.log(typeof isCool); // boolean
        console.log(typeof x); // object (wrong by JS! Yes, it's null)
        console.log(typeof y); // undefined

        // 1:
        // Using the keyword "let" to declare our 3 variables:
        let exam1 = 80;
        let exam2 = 92;
        let exam3 = 87;

        let total = exam1 + exam2 + exam3;
        let avg1 = total / 3;

        // or avg2:
        // do it all in one line...

        console.log(avg1);
