            Variable is just a container inside the Computer Memory (RAM)
            Random Access Memory that contains some data.

            it's a place to hold some data temporarily while the file still running

        3 ways:
        - var (since the beginning of JS - old way) => globally level scope
        - let (the modern one, added in ES6/ ES2015) => block-level scope
        - const => block-level scope
        */

        JS is not statically typed language:

        so we do not use => const name:string;

        in "TypeScript" which is a superset of JavaScript
        it's JS with some added features
        so it has the static typing feature: look at "TypeScript"

        /*
        Variable Naming Rules:
        **********************
        1. No spaces, but we can use the underscore symbol: _
        2. We can't start with numbers
        3. We can't add special characters % ^ etc...

        In JS we have a naming convention that we should follow:
        is called "camelCase" ==> myFinalExam

        in other programming languages like C#:
        they have "PascalCase" ==> MyFinalExam

        in other programming languages like Python:
        they have "snake_case" ==> my_final_exam

         examples:
         a variable for full name => var fullName
        */

        /*
       Primitive Data Type:
       directly assigned to memory
       - string
       - number
       - boolean
       - null
       - undefined
       - symbol (added in ES6 (2015))

        const name = 'Alex Chow'; // single quote
        const course = "JavaScript"; // double quote
