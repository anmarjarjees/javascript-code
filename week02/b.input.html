       Our new function to learn is prompt():
       **************************************
       In this file we will use a new function named prompt() to help us getting data from the user
       We learnt how to output/print the data using alert() and console.log()

       for example, this prompt function can accept two parameters:
         - prompt("The text to be displayed", default value);
         - notice that default value is "optional" which means we can write (put) it or just ignore it

         prompt("Text that we want to display", default value)
    */

        let clientName = prompt("Hi there! What's your name please?");
        console.log("Your full name is: " + clientName);
        // Or:
        /* 
        document.write() is like echo() in PHP :-)
        */
        document.write("Your full name is: " + clientName);
        
        console.log(typeof (clientName));

        /* 
        Anything in JS is an object
        */
        console.log("You name has "+clientName.length+" characters");


        let clientAge = prompt("Hi " + clientName + "! How old are you please?");
        console.log(typeof (clientAge));

        // Below: if the user didn't put any value for the first/second exam, the default value will be 0
        let exam1 = prompt("Enter the value of your first exam:", 0); // 10 as a number => prompt will return "10"
        let exam2 = prompt("Enter the value of your second exam:", 0); // 8 as a number => prompt will return "8"

           // Because the two values are returned from the prompt() function as string
        // So JS will use the + for concatenating these two string variables
        var total = exam1 + exam2; // "10" + "8" = "108"
        console.log("The total of exam1 and exam2 is: " + total);

        /* 
        in Python :-)
        age = int(input("Enter your age"))
        average = float(input("Enter your average"))

        In JS:
        parseInt() => can accept whole and ignore the decimal if any
        parseFloat() => can accept both whole (int) and decimal (float)
        We have two built-in JS functions to explicitly convert (text value) to (numeric value)

        - parseFloat() ==> to deal with integer (Whole) or float (decimal) numbers
        example: 89.75 or even 89

        - parseInt() ==> to deal only with integer(Whole) value only
          int is short for integer
          example: 89 ==> it has to be an integer value (no decimal point)

        Note:
        parseFloat works with the both types of numbers: integers and decimals
        parseInt can work only with whole number and it will ignore the decimals

        Examples:
        parseFloat("90.75") ==> 90.75 as numeric value
        parseInt("90.75") ==> 90 as numeric value (ignore the decimals!!!!)
        parseInt("7") ==> 7 as numeric value

        be careful with this example below:
        parseInt("78.5") ==> 78 (ignore the decimals!!!!)
        */

        let book1 = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the price of your first book")); // 78.56
        let book2 = prompt("Enter the price of your second book"); // 34.18
        book2 = parseFloat(book2);

        let bookTotal = book1 + book2;
        console.log("The total of your two books is: $" + bookTotal);
        document.write("<p>The total of your two books is: $" + bookTotal+"</p>");


        /*
            Like Any Programming language, JavaScript also follows the Math rules (like MS Excel):
            PEDMAS OR BEDMAS
            P => Parenthesis: ( and ) OR B => Brackets
            E => Exponent => example: 5 to the power of 2 which means 5 x 5 = 25
            D => Division
            M => Multiplication
            A => Addition
            S => Subtraction
        */


        /*
        Besides these two very specific functions that convert text to numbers:
        - parseFloat()
        - parseInt()
    
        JS also has another general function to convert text to number:
        Number() <= be careful that N is capital
        you can see that Number() function doesn't follow the naming convention "camelCase"
        because it's a "Constructor"
    
        The Number() function converts the object argument to a number that represents the object's value.
        If the value cannot be converted to a legal number, NaN is returned.
        */
        let num1 = Number(prompt("Please enter your first number: ", 0));
        let num2 = Number(prompt("Please enter your second number: ", 0));

        let addNumbers = num1 + num2;
        alert("The total of your two numbers is: " + addNumbers);

        /*
        confirm() will return "true" if OK button is clicked 
        or "false" if CANCEL button is clicked
        */
        confirm("Click OK to accept the deal of cancel to reject it!");
    
        // testing:
        let boolValue = confirm("Click either OK or Cancel:");
        console.log(boolValue);
