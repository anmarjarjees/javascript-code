            functions are useful if you want to repeat/reuse the same code many times.
            So instead of typing 4 lines of code and make a copy and paste them 3 times (for example),
            we can just encapsulate them inside a custom function
            (function that belongs to us not to JavaScript) block
            and just call that function to execute its code when we need it

            Review: Examples of some JavaScript built-in functions or methods that we have used:
            - alert()
            - prompt()
            - parseFloat()
            - parseInt()
            - document.write()
            - console.log()

            Method and Function:
            Yes we use these two words interchangeably or we always switching between them like saying function or method but they are not exactly the same:

            Function: is just a function name by itself
            functionName() ==> like parseFloat() or parseInt()

            Method: is a function attached to an "object" using the "dot" notation
            object.methodName() ==> like console.log() or document.write()

            We will have more explanation about "objects" later
        */

        // Task: Create a function to accept any number then output even or odd message based on the number
        // this function needs to have a number to test,
        // so we have to pass this "number" as an argument to the function
        /*
            Review:
            to find if the number is even or odd:
            we can divide the number by 2 then check the "Remainder"
            if the remainder is 0 then it's an even number
            else it's an odd number
    
            in JS the operation to get the remainder named modulo "%"
        */
        // 1) Create a function:
        function testEvenOdd(number) {
            if (number % 2 == 0) {
                document.write("Your number " + number + " is even");
            } else if (number % 2 == 1) {
                document.write("Your number " + number + " is odd");
            } else {
                document.write("Invalid Number!");
            }
        }

        // This function has two parameters to accept two arguments:
        // First parameter (placeholder) is "content" => The content we want to display
        // Second parameter (placeholder) is "element" => The HTML element/tag we like to use
        // Example: JavaScript and h1 => <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        // parameters
        function display(content, element) {
            // document.write("<" + element + ">" + content + "</" + element + ">");
            // OR
            document.write(`<${element}>${content}</${element}>`);
        }

        // arguments
        display("JavaScript", "h1");

        /*
    most of the time, we don't want the function to output (print) the result into the browser,
    we just need to get the result and save it into a variable for example.

    Task:
    Create a function that:
    1- Accepts two numeric values [two placeholder variables, parameters]
    these two variables will be numbers to represent exam marks, or assignments marks, or project marks, etc..

    2- Find the average of these two numbers (two marks)
    3- Return the result (average value)!

    so this function will have something new which is "returning a value".
    We don't want this function to print/output the result immediately in the browser!
    We just want this function give us (return) the result

    In this case will need to use the JavaScript keyword "return"

    so to summarize;
    our own custom functions can return values
    like other built-in JavaScript functions that return values.

    for example:
    we used "prompt()" to return whatever the user inputs (as a string):
    var userName = prompt("What's your name?");

    create a simple function to receive two numeric values
    this function will return the average of these two values

    build the function block:
    function myFunction() { }
    between () ==> function parameter(s)
    */

        // 1. Create a function:
        // with the function's name we also use camelCase, and let's name it "findAverage"
        // This function should return the average of any two numeric values:
        function findAverage(value1, value2) {
            // just find the average:
            var average = (value1 + value2) / 2;
            /*
                this function is supposed to return the value of the average
                as the function name indicates "average",
                and that's why it's better to remove the code for printing which is document write.
            */
            // document.write("<br>" + average);


            // since we need get the value of average outside the function
            // we can let our function findAverage return the value of average
            // we can simply use the keyword return:
            // output the value of average to our internal code not to the user screen to the HTM: document

            /*
            return keyword will:
            - return the value of the local variable "average" inside the function
            to any global variable outside the function
            - Terminate the function
            */
            return average;
        }

        // let's use our function in different example:
        let exam1 = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your first exam"));
        let exam2 = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your second exam"));

        let examAvg = findAverage(exam1, exam2);

        document.write("<p> the average of " + exam1 + " and " + exam2 + " is: " + examAvg + "</p>");
