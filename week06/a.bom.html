        ** Introduction to the Browser Object Model (BOM) **

        The Browser Object Model (BOM):
        - a collection of objects that the browser provides
        - allowing us to interact with the browser window and the browser environment itself
        - With BOM, we can control various aspects of the web browser, such as:
            > The browser window
            > The location of the current page
            > The browser's history and more!

        In JavaScript, we commonly use the "window" object as our starting point for interacting 
        with the BOM. It represents the browser window that contains the current webpage.

        Some key methods of the BOM include (we already practiced them):
        - "alert()" 
        - "prompt()"
        - "confirm()"
        - "document.write()"

        NOTE: Used to directly write content to the document but it's not recommended to be used in modern practice.

        // Example 1: Alert message (basic popup message to the user)
        alert("Learning about BOM!");
        
        // Example 2: Another way of calling alert using the 'window' object (same as above)
        window.alert("BOM: Browser Object Model");

        // Example 3: Prompt for user input (this will create a popup asking the user for their name)
        var userName = window.prompt("What is your name?");
        console.log("User entered:", userName); // output: the entered name to the console

        // Example 4: Using the confirm method (asks for confirmation with Yes/No)
        var userConfirmed = window.confirm("Do you want to leave?");
        console.log("User confirmed:", userConfirmed); // output: true if Yes, false if No

        // Example 5: Writing directly to the HTML document (note: this overwrites content on the page)
        window.document.write("<h2>Welcome to the Browser Object Model, " + userName + "!</h2>");

        /*
        ** Understanding BOM's Window Object **
        
        The 'window' object is the global object in the browser environment, 
        meaning it represents
        the entire browser window. We can use it to:
        - Access browser properties (like screen size, history, etc.)
        - Control the browser window (open new windows, navigate, reload, etc.)
        */

        // Example 6: Navigating to a different URL
        window.location.href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting"; // This will redirect the user to a new page.
        // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location

        // Example 7: Opening a new browser window/tab
        window.open("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting", "_blank"); // Open the website in a new tab.

        // Example 8: Reloading the current page
        // window.location.reload(); // Uncomment to reload the page

        /*
        ** Additional BOM Features **
        
        Here are a couple of other BOM objects you can use:

        - The 'navigator' object provides information about the user's browser.
        - The 'screen' object provides information about the user's screen size.

        Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator
        */

        // Example 9: Displaying the browser's language
        console.log("Browser language: " + navigator.language); // Shows the browser's default language

        /*
        ** Bonus: Handling the History of the Browser **
        
        The BOM also allows us to interact with the browser's history, which means we can:
        - Move back and forth in the history stack
        - Retrieve information about previously visited pages

        Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History
        */

        // Example 10: Going back to the previous page in history
        // window.history.back(); // Uncomment to go back in history (if possible)
